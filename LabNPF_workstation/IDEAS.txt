IDEA #1

Create an entry in the LabWiki listing our workstations:

PC-VonNeumann
CPU: Intel i7-2600 @ 3.40GHz
RAM: 8 GB
GPU: (none)
OS Disk: 60 GB (SSD)
Storage Disk: 2 TB
Network Name: FPCEUP-014-D01

OS: Windows 7 Professional 64-bit SP1
EEGLAB version: 14.1.2b
ERPLAB version: 7.0.0
Standardized toolbox locations ("C:\LabNPF_workstation\matlab_toolboxes\")? YES


PC-LabNPF
CPU: Intel i7-7700 @ 3.60 GHz
RAM: 16 GB
GPU: (none)
OS Disk: 240 GB (SSD)
Storage Disk: 2 TB
Network Name: FPCEUP-014-D02

OS: Windows 10 Enterprise 64-bit
EEGLAB version: 13.6.5b
ERPLAB version: 6.1.3
Standardized toolbox locations ("C:\LabNPF_workstation\matlab_toolboxes\")? No



(wiki text)
Each lab workstation will have a folder "C:\LabNPF_workstation" to store files related to managing the workstation, matlab toolboxes, and other lab-related files. This allows users to quickly find the relevant information about the lab software that is installed and to easily perform updates.

(IDEA: This folder should be backed up in the LabWiki).

Subfolders:
"\_manage_workstation"
	- Link to LabWiki section on the lab's workstations
	- Text file with the specifications of the PC (Speccy)
	- Scripts for activation of softare (e.g., Microsoft Office U.Porto KMS activation)
	- Other files relevant for managing the workstations
"\matlab_toolboxes"
	- Place toolbox folders here (e.g., EEGLAB).
	- When installing the toolbox, add the toolbox folder to the Matlab path, and save.
	- Update the LabWiki to correctly show the installed toolboxes and version numbers.
	-(add this folder to the Matlab path without subfolders and save)
"\r_scripts"
	- Scripts for installing important R packages automatically when R is updated.
	- Maintain version control.
